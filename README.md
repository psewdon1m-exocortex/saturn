# Saturn

Saturn is the Exocortex storage gateway and operator-facing file service. The
implementation entry point is [docs/implementation/README.md](docs/implementation/README.md);
the complete target architecture is documented in
[docs/technical_solution_storage_gateway.md](docs/technical_solution_storage_gateway.md).

## Verification

Install the pinned workspace dependencies and run the production-like suite:

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.24.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm verify:stage:13
python3 scripts/pre-push-gate.py --upstream-result success
```

The final command evaluates the versioned seven-area policy in
[.github/pre-push-gate.json](.github/pre-push-gate.json). GitHub Actions runs the
same policy after native verification on every push to `main` and before a tag
release can publish artifacts.

## Runtime storage profile

The bootstrap `STORAGE_*` values remain the first-start fallback. API and worker
also require the same protected writable `STORAGE_RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR` (default
`data/storage-runtime`; production `/var/lib/vault/storage-runtime`). An owner
may validate and select another SFTP target in Settings → Security. This rebuilds
the active catalog for that independent target and migrates no file bytes. See
[runtime storage switching](docs/implementation/RUNTIME_STORAGE_SWITCHING.md).
